`%ford examples`

`%ford` is the urbit build system.  These examples show how to use `%ford` to render data to the web.

Assuming you have the files inside a running urbit pier, you can then access them through the web:

    http://localhost:8443/examples/[n]

or

    http://localhost:8443/examples/[n]/page

where `[n]` is the number of the example.
