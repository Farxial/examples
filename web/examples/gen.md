`:dojo examples`

Generators are short shell scripts. 

Generators live under `gen/` in a `%clay` desk, and are invoked with `+name` at the `:dojo` prompt.

By convention we nest all of our generators inside the `examples/` folder, so to run one you'll need the `examples/` prefix:

    ~your-urbit:dojo> :examples/euler1 2

Note: Euler #'s 5, 14 take a little while to evaluate.
