This directory contains Hoon modules. To try one in `dojo`, you can do:

    > /+  name

to add the library `name` to the dojo subject. (Note the two spaces - this is a tall-form rune.) Each library contains a `++test` arm to test its functionality - type `test:name` at the `dojo` prompt.

When you're done, simply enter a blank `/+` to reset `:dojo` to the normal
subject.
